<!ELEMENT transfer-weights (rule-group+)>
<!-- 
     'transfer-weights' is a root element.
-->

<!ELEMENT rule-group (rule+)>
<!--
     An element used to keep all mutually ambiguous rules together.
-->

<!ELEMENT rule (pattern+)>
<!ATTLIST rule id ID #REQUIRED
               md5 CDATA #REQUIRED
               comment CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!-- 
      Each rule has a list of patterns that define its weights.
      * attribute 'id' is a unique rule identifier used to refer to the rule
        as defined in transfer file.  It is not restricted to integers, and it is
        encouraged to make id meaningful.
      * attribute 'md5' is md5 sum of the corresponding rule entry text 
        from transfer file with whitespace removed.  It is used to check 
        if text of the rule hasn't changed since the weights were calculated.
      * attribute 'comment' allows to put in comments about the purpose of
        the rule.

<!ELEMENT pattern (pattern-item+)>
<!ATTLIST pattern weight CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!-- 
      The pattern is specified in terms of pattern items, each one
      representing a lexical form in the matched pattern. 
-->

<!ELEMENT pattern-item EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST pattern-item lemma CDATA #IMPLIED 
                       tags CDATA #REQUIRED> 
<!-- 
     Each 'pattern-item' (pattern item) represents a set of lexical forms
     and has a mandatory attribute 'tags' whose value is a sequence of
     dot-separated tag names; this sequence is a subsequence of the
     tag sequence defining each possible lexical form. For example,
     tags="n.f" would match all lexical forms containing this tag
     sequence, such as "^casa<n><f><pl>$".

     In addition, an optional attribute, "lemma", may be used to
     define lexical forms having a particular substring in their lemma.

     This element is similar to 'cat-item' used in transfer files.
